# ducker
Quack at your docs

```
<aldeka_a_> idea for trolling: give a lightning talk at pycon about a 
new program called 'ducker', a helpful eliza-type bot that will help you 
rubber-duck through problems with major libraries, starting with docker 
but expanding outward from there
<aldeka_a_> like, a program that consumes sphinx documentation and 
outputs incisive 20-questions style questions. or at least feigns 
nodding in sympathy well.
<aldeka_a_> actually the more I think about it the more I think this is 
something that could be a real and useful thing. troll fail.
```
